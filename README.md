Milestone 1: Project Overview
In this milestone, we:
Understood the overall structure of a MERN project.
Learned the foundational steps of setting up a new project.
Explored key functionalities of an e-commerce application, such as:
User Authentication: Secure login and registration.
This milestone focused on preparing the foundation for upcoming project stages by setting up the repository and understanding the application's goals and features.

E-Commerce App - Milestone 2 
This milestone sets up the frontend with React and Tailwind CSS, and the backend with Node.js.
The project follows a structured folder hierarchy with separate frontend and backend directories.
The first user-facing feature, the Login Page, has been built with functionality and styling.
Check the repository for the complete setup and progress.

E-Commerce App - Milestone 3 
This milestone establishes the backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
A structured folder hierarchy is implemented with routes, controllers, models, and middleware.
The server is configured to handle API requests and connect to MongoDB for data storage.
Basic error handling is added to improve debugging and user experience.

E-Commerce App - Milestone 4 
This milestone introduces user management and file uploads in the backend.
A User Model is created using MongoDB schemas to structure user data.
A User Controller is implemented to handle user-related requests like registration and retrieval.
Multer is configured to enable file uploads, allowing users to store images on the server.
The project repository is updated with these features and documented in the README.
